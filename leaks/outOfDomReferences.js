Thereâ€™s an additional consideration that has to be taken into account 
when it comes to references to inner or leaf nodes inside a DOM tree. If you keep a reference to a 
table cell (a <td> tag) in your code and decide to remove the table from the DOM yet keep 
the reference to that particular cell, you can expect a major memory leak to follow. 
You might think that the garbage collector would free up everything but that cell. 
This will not be the case, however. Since the cell is a child node of the table and children 
keep references to their parents, this single reference to the table cell would keep the whole 
table in memory.
